            <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
              As the third essential pillar in my holistic approach to wellness, nutrition completes the 
              mind-body-nourishment trilogy, working in harmony with healing and movement practices.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              My approach integrates modern nutritional science with ancient wisdom traditions, 
              recognizing that truly nourishing food connects us to nature, community, and ourselves.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When we transform our relationship with food, we transform our entire beingâ€”creating 
              a foundation for vibrant health that supports both physical vitality and spiritual growth.
